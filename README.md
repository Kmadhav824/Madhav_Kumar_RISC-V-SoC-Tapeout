## 🧠 Overview
This repository documents my journey through the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**, where I learned to design a System-on-Chip from RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Each week builds on the previous, culminating in a complete chip layout ready for fabrication.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Iverilog** – For RTL simulation
- **Yosys** – Open-source synthesis tool
- **GTKWave** – Waveform viewer
- **OpenLane** – Physical design flow
- **Magic** – Layout visualization
- **KLayout** – GDSII inspection
